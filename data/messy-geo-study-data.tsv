Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of peripheral blood samples of moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients treated with anti-TNF drugs	Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of peripheral blood samples of moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients treated with anti-TNF drugs. Patients were distributed on Excellent Responders (ER) if they achieved PASI90 (a 90% reduction with respect to baseline PASI) at 3 and 6 months of treatment with anti-TNF drugs and Partial responders if they did not achieve a PASI75 (a 75% reduction with respect to baseline PASI) at 3 and 6 months of treatment. more...

Epigenomic analysis of sperm cells from patients with psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis without arthritis, and healthy controls	Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of motile spermatozoa from 23 patients with psoriasis without arthritis, 13 psoriatic arthritis, and 18 unaffected controls using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450k v1 platform.

Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of psoriatic and normal skin tissues	Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of psoriatic (PP), paired uninvolved psoriatic (PN) and normal skin tissues (NN). The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs in 135 PP, 41PN and 62 NN tissues which were obtained from those who underwent skin biospsies. We not only revealed a genome-wide methylation level pattern for psoriasis, but also identified a strong association between the skin-specific DNAm of 9 DMS and psoriasis.

Narrow-band UVB phototherapy reverses DNA methylation changes in psoriatic epidermis	To obtain a comprehensive DNA methylation signature specific for the epidermal component of psoriasis and to analyze methylation changes during therapy, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of epidermal cells from 12 patients undergoing narrow-band UVB phototherapy and 12 corresponding healthy controls. A distinct DNA methylation pattern was seen in psoriasis compared to controls. An overall hypomethylation was found in psoriasis and 3665 methylation variable positions were identified. more...

Genome wide DNA methylation of Psoriasis patients from disease and adjacent Normal skin skin tissue samples	Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of psoriatic disease skin tissue and adjacent Normal skin samples. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in tissue samples. Total 48 samples were taken including 24 paired tissues.
